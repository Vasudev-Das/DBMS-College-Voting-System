# DBMS-College-Voting-System
The College Voting System was developed using PostgreSQL as the backend database and Python Flask to connect the user interface with the database. The system securely records each vote with a timestamp, ensuring data integrity, preventing duplicate voting, and enabling transparent and reliable vote management.
